  
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and audio are fundamentally different in how they represent and handle sound. MIDI is like a set of digital sheet music telling instruments what to play, whereas audio is a recorded performance of the music itself.

- **MIDI** - MIDI is a protocol designed for recording and playing back music on digital synthesizers. It is not a sound in itself, but a set of digital instructions or data. MIDI data contain information such as what note is played, when it is played, how long it's held, and how hard it's hit. MIDI data is small because it only contain a series of instructions, not actual sound recordings. In order to hear music represented as MIDI, there needs to sound source (the synthesizer or virtual instrument) that interprets the MIDI data and generates sound. The quality of the sound produced by a MIDI data depends on the sound source that interprets the MIDI data.
- **Audio** - Audio data are  recordings of the actual sound waves produced by instruments, voices, or any acoustic source. An audio data contains a digital representation of the sound wave including all the frequencies and nuances of the sound as it was captured. Audio data tend to be much larger than MIDI data. The size depends on the quality and length of the recording. Once recorded, audio can be edited and processed, but the fundamental aspects of the performance (like the notes played or the timbre of the instrument) cannot be changed as easily as with MIDI.
