Latency is to the delay between a note played on a MIDI controller (like a keyboard) and the time it is heard from the output (such as speakers or headphones).

Musicians rely on immediate auditory feedback when they play an instrument. Good rhythm and precise timing are fundamental to most music. High latency can be problematic for live performances or when recording, as it can cause a noticeable delay between a musician's performance and what they hear back, potentially disrupting their timing and performance. When using electronic instruments like MIDI keyboards or, low latency is essential to ensure that the sound produced by these digital sources feels responsive and natural.

This delay is usually measured in milliseconds (ms) and can be influenced by several factors in the digital audio signal chain.

In the context of MIDI playback there can be several causes of latency:

- **Digital Processing**: The time taken by the computer or digital audio processor to apply effects, mix, or route the audio signal.
- **MIDI to Audio generation**: Converting the MIDI signals to an analog signal for playback (like generating piano sounds)
- **Buffering**: Digital audio systems use buffers to handle audio data, and the size of these buffers can affect latency. The buffer size can be set in the music software and should be kept as low as possible without causing problems. Refer to the user guide of you music software (DAW) for more information
