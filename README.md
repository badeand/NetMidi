## Introduction

NetMIDI is a free and open source application that allows you to send real time MIDI data over the internet. It acts as a virtual MIDI cable over the network and can be used to perform music together over internet or local network.

The client is an application downloaded from the internet running on each participants computer. It is installed on each participants computer and is used to send and receive data from the other participants via the server. All clients communicate with a common server that recieves MIDI data and re-broadcasts data to all clients.

Using the local client requires some knowledge of how to use MIDI data and MIDI devices.

Setting up a server requires some knowledge of Linux and redimentary knowledge of networks. 

It takes some time to transfer MIDI data over the internet. Therefore, to ensure low latency, server should be located near each client (e.g in the same county).
